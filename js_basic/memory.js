// memory storage
// there are two type of 
// -> stack
// -> heap

// All primitive datatype is store in the stack memory in which we use the LIFO if we want to change and updata the
// value than it's original value is not efficted...it's provide the copy of value 

// All non-primitive datatype is store in the heap memory... if we want to change and updata the
// value than it's original value is efficted... it's take the reference of original value
